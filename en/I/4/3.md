In <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/en/I/2/4">Chapter 3</a>, we discussed the need to measure consumer welfare in monetary terms. One of the reasons we mentioned was the ability to assess the social impact of a new technology. At this point, the reason should be clear: a technological innovation (that is, in the language of our simple mathematical model of production, a higher value of the productivity parameter $A$) leads to lower costs for firms and thus a rightward shift of the supply curve. In the new equilibrium — which lies further southeast along the demand curve — the price is lower and the quantity exchanged is higher. Consumer surplus increases: through the market mechanism, the benefits of lower costs are partially passed on to consumers.

But that’s only part of the story. What happens to producer surplus? Do firms earn higher or lower profits? The answer is not straightforward. On the one hand, firms face lower unit costs and sell a larger quantity — two effects that tend to boost profits. On the other hand, the lower selling price compresses profit margins. The final effect on producer surplus depends on the balance between these opposing forces and, as we will see, is closely related to the concept of <b>demand elasticity</b>, which we will introduce shortly.

Before introducing that concept, let’s look at an example that illustrates the potentially ambiguous effect of a technological innovation on producer surplus. Assume a linear demand function: $P = 12 - Q$, where $P$ is the price per kilogram and $Q$ is the quantity in tons. Consider three supply scenarios. In the first (left graph in the figure below), supply is given by $P = 2Q$. In the second (middle graph), a technological innovation lowers marginal costs: the supply function is $P = Q$. In the third (right graph), a further technological advance leads to the supply function $P = Q/2$.
