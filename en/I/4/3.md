In <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/en/I/2/4">Chapter 3</a>, we discussed the need to measure consumer welfare in monetary terms. One of the reasons we mentioned was the ability to assess the social impact of a new technology. At this point, the reason should be clear: a technological innovation (that is, in the language of our simple mathematical model of production, a higher value of the productivity parameter $A$) leads to lower costs for firms and thus a rightward shift of the supply curve. In the new equilibrium — which lies further southeast along the demand curve — the price is lower and the quantity exchanged is higher. Consumer surplus increases: through the market mechanism, the benefits of lower costs are partially passed on to consumers.

But that’s only part of the story. What happens to producer surplus? Do firms earn higher or lower profits? The answer is not straightforward. On the one hand, firms face lower unit costs and sell a larger quantity — two effects that tend to boost profits. On the other hand, the lower selling price compresses profit margins. The final effect on producer surplus depends on the balance between these opposing forces and, as we will see, is closely linked to the concept of <b>demand elasticity</b>—a key idea

for understanding who gains or loses—and by how much—in response to external <i>shocks</i> such as technological innovations or government interventions like taxes and subsidies.

Before introducing that concept, we give an example illustrating the potentially ambiguous effect of a technological innovation on producer surplus. Assume a linear demand function: $P = 10 - Q$, where $P$ is the price per kilogram and $Q$ is the quantity in tons. Consider three supply scenarios. In the first (left graph in the figure below), supply is given by $P = 4Q$. In the second (middle graph), a technological innovation lowers marginal costs: the supply function is $P = (2/3)Q$. In the third (right graph), a further technological advance leads to the supply function $P = (1/4)Q$.

Technological progress always has a positive effect on collective welfare (total surplus). Besides confirming our intuition, this is also clear geometrically: total surplus corresponds to the area of a triangle with base equal to the intercept of the demand curve and height equal to the equilibrium quantity, which increases as the supply curve shifts to the right. The effect on consumer surplus is equally straightforward: as the equilibrium price falls, consumer surplus increases.

Producer surplus, however, behaves differently: it increases from the first to the second scenario, but decreases from the second to the third. The geometry of the graph helps explain why: producer surplus (green area) is always equal to half of consumers' <i>expenditure</i>—the product of price and equilibrium quantity. So to understand how producer surplus changes, we simply need to track changes in expenditure.

In the first scenario, expenditure is $8 \times 2000 = €16,000$, and producer surplus is €8,000. In the second, the price drops from 8 to 4 euros per kilo (−50%), while the quantity rises from 2 to 6 tons (+200%)—a more than proportional increase. Consumers' expenditure rises to $4 \times 6000 = €24,000$, and producer surplus to €12,000. The positive effect of increased sales (at lower cost) outweighs the negative impact of the lower price. In the third scenario, the opposite occurs: the price drops from 4 to 2 (−50%), but the quantity only increases from 6 to 8 tons (+33%). In this case, expenditure—and thus producer surplus—declines.
