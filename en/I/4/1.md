A perfectly competitive market is composed of a large number of buyers and sellers, each of whom acts as a <i>price taker</i>, meaning they accept the market price as given and cannot influence it individually. The market price is determined by an "invisible hand" that coordinates consumers and firms, leading to a point where the total quantity demanded equals the total quantity supplied. As we will see, this results in a socially efficient outcome: the quantity produced (and consumed) is exactly the one that maximizes collective welfare.












<h2 id="subsec_mktDS">Market Demand</h2>

The <b>market demand curve</b> represents the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity that consumers are collectively willing to purchase. It is obtained by aggregating individual demand curves <i>horizontally</i>, that is, by summing the quantities demanded by individual consumers at each price level.

The figure below illustrates an example. To simplify the analysis, we assume that consumers are identical and therefore have the same individual demand function. Moreover, we assume that this function is <i>linear</i> — a simplification we will often adopt in the remainder of these notes to facilitate graphical and analytical reasoning.

As shown in the figure, the market demand curve shifts to the right or to the left as the number of consumers in the market increases or decreases. Since it results from the horizontal summation of individual demand curves, the market demand curve also shifts in response to changes in the factors that affect individual demand. In particular, it is easy to see (although we do not show it in the figure) that:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    When all consumers regard the good as normal (an assumption always valid given the type of preferences discussed in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/it/I/2/3#normalgood">Chapter 2</a>), a change in income shifts the market demand curve to the right if income increases, or to the left if income decreases.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    Similarly, a change in the price of a substitute good causes the market demand curve to shift to the right if the price of the substitute rises, or to the left if it falls.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>















<h2 id="subsec_compeqSR">Short-Run Supply and Equilibrium</h2>

In the short run, a situation in which the number of firms in the market is fixed, the <b>short-run market supply</b> curve represents the relationship between the price of the good and the quantity that the firms present in the market are collectively willing to sell. It is obtained in a way analogous to market demand, that is, by horizontally summing the individual short-run supply curves. The example in the figure below uses data from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/it/I/3/4#firm/supplySR">Figure 3.19</a>.

<a id="gr_equilibrium/mktsupplySR"><strong>Figure 4.2 (equilibrium/mktsupplySR)</strong></a>
{% include textbook-graph.html graph="equilibrium/gr_mktsupplySR" %}

The short-run market supply curve shifts to the right or left respectively as the number of firms in the market increases or decreases. It is appropriate here to make considerations similar to those previously made regarding market demand. Being the result of the horizontal summation of individual supply curves, the market supply also shifts in response to changes in factors that affect individual supply. In particular, it is easy to see (and we will show it in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/it/I/3/4#firm/compeqSR">Figure 4.3</a> below) that:
<ul>
	<li>
		<p> A reduction in firms’ marginal cost (due to an increase in the productivity parameter $A$, or a decrease in the price of the labor factor, $W$) causes a rightward shift of the short-run market supply curve. Conversely, an increase in marginal cost causes a leftward shift.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> The short-run market supply curve does not depend on firms’ fixed costs. This is obvious given that the firms’ optimal short-run choice does not depend on those costs.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
In a <b>short-run equilibrium</b>, the market price is such that the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by the firms present in the market. The following figure illustrates the equilibrium and how it depends on (some of) the factors determining demand and supply.

<h2 id="subsec_compeqLR">Long-Run Supply and Equilibrium</h2>

As we saw in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/it/I/3/3#subsec_SRLR">Section 3.3</a>, in the long run, firms operating in a market may choose to shut down and exit. One of the key assumptions underlying perfect competition is that, likewise, new firms that are initially inactive can choose to enter the market. There is therefore a potenatially infinite number of sellers.

When incumbent firms earn positive economic profits, new firms have an incentive to enter. The entry of new firms increases overall supply, leading to a decrease in the equilibrium price. Conversely, when profits are negative, some firms will choose to exit the market, reducing total supply and causing the equilibrium price to rise.

<a id="gr_equilibrium/mktsupplyLR"><strong>Figura 4.XX (equilibrium/mktsupplyLR)</strong></a>
{% include textbook-graph.html graph="equilibrium/gr_mktsupplyLR" %}


The process of entry and exit continues until profits become zero — that is, when <i>the market price equals the minimum average cost</i>. At this point, the market reaches its <b>long-run equilibrium</b>: no new firm has an incentive to enter, being indifferent between entering or staying out; and no incumbent firm has an incentive to exit, as it is covering exactly its costs.
