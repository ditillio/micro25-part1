The <b>total surplus</b> in a market — equal to the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus — represents a measure of the overall welfare generated by trade. In this section, we will examine how, under perfect competition, the market mechanism leads to an efficient allocation of resources, that is, to the maximization of total surplus. In later chapters, we will explore situations in which obstacles to contracting — such as market power, externalities, or informational asymmetries — can result in suboptimal levels of social welfare.

In a short-run competitive equilibrium, total surplus is maximized <i>given the existing technological resources</i>, that is, considering that the number of firms — and hence the number of production units — is fixed. There is no alternative quantity produced and consumed, nor any different allocation of the equilibrium quantity among the existing firms, that would increase total surplus.

The following figure, based on the data from <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/it/I/4/1#gr_equilibrium/compeqSR">Figure 4.3</a>, illustrates these properties.
